## The Dream

For the past couple of months, we have been discussing revamping the IPFS ALL HANDS meetings. If you want more context, please see issue https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/636.

We want the IPFS hands-on meeting act as a space where we can showcase all of our hard work and game changing projects.The IPFS meetings give viewers a taste of some of the problems we are tackling.


## What's in it for you? üò∫

The main purpose of the IPFS ALL HANDS ON CALL is to highlight the most exciting work in the broader IPFS community and disseminate high-value knowledge to the many teams improving IPFS, building on top of it, or doing relevant research. You can use this platform to:

1. Attract skilled contributors to your endeavor

2. Motivate the community about adding support for a new feature

3. Find new partners, capabilities, or challenges for your project to work on/with.


The IPFS ALL HANDS ON CALL also gives you a chance to practice public speaking skills. Think of it as a [Toast Masters](https://www.toastmasters.org/) for the IPFS crowd. Below are some public speaking resources.
